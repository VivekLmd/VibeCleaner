## Security Policy

### Reporting a Vulnerability
- Please do not disclose security issues publicly.
- Open a private report via GitHub Security Advisories ("Report a vulnerability" in the repo’s Security tab), or if unavailable, open a minimal issue asking maintainers to enable advisories.
- Include steps to reproduce, affected versions, and any relevant logs.

### Response Timeline
- We aim to acknowledge within 2–3 business days and provide a resolution or mitigation plan within 14 days, depending on severity and complexity.

### Supported Versions
- The latest release/main branch is supported. Older versions may receive fixes on a best-effort basis.
